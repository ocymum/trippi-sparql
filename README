Trippi RDF SPI implementation using SPARQL Update over HTTP.

To build (requires Java 8):

cd trippi-sparql ; mvn clean install

This will result in a large trippi-sparql-*.jar JAR in the trippi-sparql/trippi-sparql/target/ directory
which contains the connector and its dependencies, and a trippi-sparql-fcrepo-webapp-*.war WAR in
trippi-sparql/trippi-sparql-fcrepo-webapp/target . To use this connector with Fedora 3, this large JAR
can be dropped into the WEB-INF/lib/ directory of a Fedora 3 web-application, or the WAR file can be
used (it is simply the ordinary Fedora 3 web-application with the JAR pre-installed). Then, a <datastore/>
element must be configured in fedora.fcfg. For each parameter except connectorClassName and updateEndpoint,
a default will be used if no <param/> element for that parameter is supplied. The default will be the value
shown in the example below, except that the default for the SPARQL CONSTRUCT Query endpoint is just the
ordinary SPARQL Query endpoint, and the default for the ordinary SPARQL Query endpoint is the SPARQL Update
endpoint. The default for graphName is as shown, but users should be aware that any relative URI used there
(the default #ri is as used by Fedora 3's Mulgara configuration) will be resolved against a static base URI
stored in the constant edu.si.trippi.impl.sparql.SparqlConnector.BASE_URI. Queries transmitted through
Fedora's Resource Index API will be automatically equipped with an appropriate BASE declaration, but
otherwise, clients are responsible for ensuring that the base URI is used correctly. A convenience method
SparqlConnector::rebase is available for the purpose.
